# Gilded_Rose_Refactoring_Kata_JS
[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/jest.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/jest)

This is my refactoring of the Gilded Rose using JavaScript. The exercise itself can be done with about 30 different programming languages. I plan to refactor this in Ruby and perhaps Clojure in the future.

The original problem can be found here: https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata

# Run Tests Using Jest:
1. Clone this repository. Type the following in your terminal: 
```
git clone https://github.com/jerminatorhits/Gilded_Rose_Refactoring_Kata_JS
```
2. Navigate to the folder labeled "test.js". 

3. If you haven't downloaded jest, you can do so here:
```
npm install --save-dev jest
```
4. Run the tests by typing:
```
npm test
```
